## For Now: Skip Instagram Setup

Since you want to focus on Facebook and TikTok first, you can:
- Skip Instagram product setup for now
- Add it later when ready
- Focus on getting Facebook and TikTok working

The "Add Product" is mainly needed for Instagram. For Facebook and TikTok, you don't need to add products - just tokens!
